# Windows Backup Timestamp Remover
Removes Windows backup timestamp from file and folder names

After restoring files and/or folders from a backup, many may look like this:

`myFile(2021_06_07 21_32_13 UTC).txt`

When they should be looking like this:

`myFile.txt`

This script accomplishes that. Simply download the .exe file, run it and enter the directory in which you want to search for files to rename.
